# This document lists the authors that have given voice to
# their decision regarding relicensing the GPL'd code from
# git.git to the GPL + gcc-exception license used by libgit2.
#
# Note that the permission is given for libgit2 use only. For
# other uses, you must ask each of the contributors yourself.
#
# To show the owners of a file in git.git, one can run the
# following command:
#
#  git blame -C -C -M -- file | \
#    sed -e 's/[^(]*(\([^0-9]*\).*/\1/' -e 's/[\t ]*$//' | \
#      sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
#
# If everyone on the list that produces are on the list in
# the recently added file "git.git-authors", it *should* be
# safe to include that code in libgit2, but make sure to
# read the file to ensure the code doesn't originate from
# somewhere else.
#
# The format of this list is
# "ok/no/ask/???"<tab>"Author"<space>"<email>"
#
# "ok" means the author consents to relicensing all their
#   contributed code (possibly with some exceptions)
# "no" means the author does not consent
# "ask" means that the contributor wants to give/withhold
#   his/her consent on a patch-by-patch basis.
# "???" means the person is a prominent contributor who has
#   not yet made his/her standpoint clear.
#
# Please try to keep the list alphabetically ordered. It will
# help in case we get all 600-ish git.git authors on it.
#
# (Paul Kocher is the author of the mozilla-sha1 implementation
#  but has otherwise not contributed to git.)
